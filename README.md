# COMP2850 Supermarket Web Application

A full-stack online supermarket web application built as part of the COMP2850 module at the University of Leeds. The system provides three distinct portals for customers, warehouse staff, and management/marketing teams, each tailored to the specific needs and workflows of that user group.

## 🧩 System Overview

The application is split into three subsystems:

- **E-Commerce** — Customers can browse products by category, search and filter the product catalogue, manage a shopping basket, apply promo codes, check out with delivery scheduling, and view their full order history with live status tracking.
- **Warehousing** — Warehouse staff access picking lists sorted by shelf location on mobile or tablet, update stock levels in real time, flag substitutions or out-of-stock items, and process incoming deliveries.
- **Management & Marketing** — Staff can view sales metrics and trends, identify best-selling and trending products by category, and export reports — all filterable by product, category and date range.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kotlin + Spring Boot | Backend REST API | Switched from Ktor to Spring Boot for better JPA and database integration support |
| HTML | Frontend markup | Core structure for all portal pages |
| CSS | Frontend styling | Custom styles layered on top of Bootstrap |
| Bootstrap 5 | UI component framework | Replaced Tailwind CSS following supervisor recommendation — provides pre-built responsive components suited to a group project |
| JavaScript | Frontend interactivity | Handles dynamic rendering, basket management, form validation and API fetch calls |
| SQLite + JDBC | Database storage | File-based, serverless — no separate database installation required |

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/) (Temurin recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

> No Node.js or database installation required — the frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS served directly from the file system, and SQLite is file-based and bundled with the project.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekunwill25/supermarket-project-2850.git
cd supermarket-project-2850
```

---

### 2. Running the Backend

```bash
cd Backend-SupermarketDatabase

# macOS / Linux
./gradlew bootRun

# Windows
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

The database is seeded automatically from `src/main/resources/data.sql` on first run — no manual setup required.

---

### 3. Running the Frontend

The frontend is plain HTML — no build step or npm install needed.

**Option A — Open directly in browser:**
Navigate to `frontend/index.html` and open it in your browser.

**Option B — Use VS Code Live Server (recommended):**
1. Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code
2. Right click `frontend/index.html` → **Open with Live Server**
3. The app will open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`

> Make sure the backend is running first so the frontend can fetch live product and category data.

---

### 4. Demo Accounts

Use these accounts to test all three portals without registering:

| User | Email | Password | Portal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dave (Customer) | `dave@freshmart.com` | `customer123` | Customer Portal |
| Sarah (Warehouse) | `sarah@freshmart.com` | `warehouse123` | Warehouse Portal |
| Emma (Management) | `emma@freshmart.com` | `manager123` | Management Portal |

These are also available as quick-fill buttons on the login page.

---

### 5. Running Backend Tests
```bash
cd Backend-SupermarketDatabase

# macOS / Linux
./gradlew test

# Windows
.\gradlew.bat test
```

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

- `main` — stable, protected branch. All changes go through pull requests.
- `feature/team/your-feature-name` — for new features
- `fix/your-fix-name` — for bug fixes

All pull requests must pass CI checks before merging. At least 2 team member approvals are required to merge into `main`.
